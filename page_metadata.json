    "summary": "1. **Type of Diagram/Content**: \n   - This is a technical engineering drawing, commonly known as an orthographic projection, often used to represent the dimensions and layout of a product or component.\n\n2. **Main Components, Elements, or Sections Visible**:\n   - The diagram includes four main views of an object: back view, front view, side view, and top view.\n   - Each view offers a different perspective of the object, detailing specific measurements and structural elements.\n\n3. **Text, Labels, or Annotations Present**:\n   - Measurements are marked with arrows indicating specific dimensions in millimeters (e.g., Ø56.00, 76.30, 163.30).\n   - Each view is labeled accordingly: BACK VIEW, FRONT VIEW, SIDE VIEW, TOP VIEW.\n   - A note at the bottom states: \"ALL DIMENSIONS ARE IN MILLIMETERS UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.\"\n   - Annotations detail drilled holes on the object (e.g., Ø4.00).\n\n4. **Processes, Flows, or Relationships Shown**:\n   - Each view corresponds to a particular side of the object, clearly illustrating the spatial layout and relationships between components such as cylindrical features and drilled holes.\n   - The dimensions suggest possible placements of other components if this is part of a larger assembly.\n\n5. **Technical Details, Measurements, or Specifications**:\n   - The object appears to have a cylindrical section with a diameter stated as Ø56.00 and extends horizontally 76.30mm in the back view.\n   - The total height is consistently marked as 163.30mm across all views.\n   - Other measurements include projections or extensions (15.00mm, 30.00mm) on the side of the object.\n   - The top view indicates a width of 8.30mm with a smaller hole of Ø5.14.\n\n6. **Overall Purpose or Function Illustrated**:\n   - The drawing seems to represent a component of a phone or phone-related project as indicated by the text stating \"MINI PROJECT PHONE.\"\n   - Given the measurements and annotations, it might illustrate a casing or structural part of a device, possibly supporting or encapsulating other components.\n\nThe drawing contains text that identifies the educational institution and the individual associated with the project. Further details connect the drawing with a specific academic assignment (e.g., \"CHANDIGARH UNIVERSITY, NAME: VANSHDEEP, UID: 24BCS12130\"). The drawing serves as a detailed plan or specification document related to engineering or technical education.",
